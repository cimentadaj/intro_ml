# What are loss functions?

* Social Scientists use metrics such as the `\(R^2\)`, `\(AIC\)`, `\(Log\text{ }likelihood\)` or `\(BIC\)`. 

* We almost always use these metrics and their purpose is to inform some of our modeling choices. 

* In machine learning, metrics such as the `\(R^2\)` and the `\(AIC\)` are called 'loss functions'

* There are two types of loss functions: continuous and binary

---

# Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)



Subtract the actual `\(Y_{i}\)` score of each respondent from the predicted `\(\hat{Y_{i}}\)` for each respondent:

&lt;img src="03_loss_trees_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

`$$RMSE = \sqrt{\sum_{i = 1}^n{\frac{(\hat{y_{i}} - y_{i})^2}{N}}}$$`

---

# Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

* This approach doesn't penalize any values and just takes the absolute error of the predictions.

* Fundamentally simpler to interpret than the `\(RMSE\)` since it's just the average absolute error. 

&lt;img src="03_loss_trees_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

`$$MAE = \sum_{i = 1}^n{\frac{|\hat{y_{i}} - y_{i}|}{N}}$$`

---

# Confusion Matrices

* The city of Berlin is working on developing an 'early warning' system that is aimed at predicting whether a family is in need of childcare support. 

* Families which received childcare support are flagged with a 1 and families which didn't received childcare support are flagged with a 0:

&lt;img src="../../img/base_df_lossfunction.svg" width="15%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Confusion Matrices

* Suppose we fit a logistic regression that returns a predicted probability for each family: 

&lt;img src="../../img/df_lossfunction_prob.svg" width="35%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Confusion Matrices

* We could assign a 1 to every respondent who has a probability above `0.5` and a 0 to every respondent with a probability below `0.5`:

&lt;img src="../../img/df_lossfunction_class.svg" width="45%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Confusion Matrices

The accuracy is the sum of all correctly predicted rows divided by the total number of predictions:

&lt;img src="../../img/confusion_matrix_50_accuracy.svg" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

* Accuracy: `\((3 + 1) / (3 + 1 + 2 + 2) = 50\%\)`

---

# Confusion Matrices

* **Sensitivity** of a model is a fancy name for the **true positive rate**.

* Sensitivity measures those that were correctly predicted only for the `1`:

&lt;img src="../../img/confusion_matrix_50_sensitivity.svg" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

* Sensitivity: `\(3 / (3 + 1) = 75\%\)`

---

# Confusion Matrices

* The **specificity** of a model measures the true false rate. 

* Specificity measures those that were correctly predicted only for the `0`:

&lt;img src="../../img/confusion_matrix_50_specificity.svg" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

* Specificity: `\(1 / (1 + 2) = 33\%\)`

---

# ROC Curves and Area Under the Curve

* The ROC curve is just another fancy name for something that is just a representation of sensitivity and specificity.

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

* In our previous example, we calculated the sensitivity and specificity assuming that the threshold for being 1 in the probability of each respondent is `0.5`. 

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&gt; What if we tried different cutoff points?

# ROC Curves and Area Under the Curve

* Assigning a 1 if the probability was above `0.3` is associated with a true positive rate (sensitivity) of `0.74`.

* Switching the cutoff to `0.7`, increases the true positive rate to `0.95`, quite an impressive benchmark. 

* At the expense of increasing sensitivity, the true false rate decreases from `0.87` to `0.53`. 

---

# ROC Curves and Area Under the Curve

* We want a cutoff that maximizes both the true positive rate and true false rate.

* Try all possible combinations:

# ROC Curves and Area Under the Curve

* This result contains the sensitivity and specificity for many different cutoff points. These results are most easy to understand by visualizing them.

* Cutoffs that improve the specificity does so at the expense of sensitivity. 

&lt;img src="03_loss_trees_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# ROC Curves and Area Under the Curve

* Instead of visualizing the specificity as the true negative rate, let's subtract 1 such that as the `X` axis increases, it means that the error is increasing:

&lt;img src="03_loss_trees_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="70%" height="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

* Ideal result:  most points cluster on the top left quadrant. 

* Sensitivity is high (the true positive rate) and the specificity is high (because `\(1 - specificity\)` will switch the direction of the accuracy to the lower values of the `X` axis).

# ROC Curves and Area Under the Curve

* The last loss function we'll discuss is a very small extension of the ROC curve: the **A**rea **U**nder the **C**urve or `\(AUC\)`. 

* `\(AUC\)` is the percentage of the plot that is under the curve. For example:

&lt;img src="03_loss_trees_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" width="70%" height="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

* The more points are located in the top left quadrant, the higher the overall accuracy of our model

* 90% of the space of the plot is under the curve.

# Decision trees

* Decision trees are tree-like diagrams. 
* They work by defining `yes-or-no` rules based on the data and assign the most common value for each respondent within their final branch.

# Decision trees

* How do we fit in R?


```r
# Define the decision tree and tell it the the dependent
# variable is continuous ('mode' = 'regression')
mod1 &lt;- decision_tree(mode = "regression") %&gt;% set_engine("rpart")

tflow &lt;-
  # Plug the data
  pisa %&gt;%
  # Begin the tidyflow
  tidyflow(seed = 23151) %&gt;%
  # Separate the data into training/testing
  plug_split(initial_split) %&gt;%
  # Plug the formula
  plug_formula(math_score ~ FISCED + HISEI + REPEAT) %&gt;%
  # Plug the model
  plug_model(mod1)

vanilla_fit &lt;- fit(tflow)
```

---
# Decision trees

* All `plug_*` functions serve to build your machine learning workflow 

* `tidyflow`: receives the data and seed

* `plug_split`: add the training/testing

* `plug_formula`/`plug_recipe`: model definition

* `plug_model`: the model used

# Bad things about Decision trees

* They overfit a lot


```r
# We can recicle the entire `tflow` from above and just replace the formula:
tflow &lt;- tflow %&gt;% replace_formula(ST102Q01TA ~ .)
fit_complex &lt;- fit(tflow)
rpart.plot(pull_tflow_fit(fit_complex)$fit)
```

&lt;img src="03_loss_trees_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png" width="70%" height="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Bad things about Decision trees

How can you address this?

* Not straight forward
* `min_n` and `tree_depth` are sometimes useful


```r
dectree &lt;- update(mod1, min_n = 200, tree_depth = 3)
tflow &lt;- tflow %&gt;% replace_model(dectree)
fit_complex &lt;- fit(tflow)
rpart.plot(pull_tflow_fit(fit_complex)$fit)
```

# Tuning decision trees

* Model tuning can help select the best `min_n` and `tree_depth`


```r
tflow &lt;-
  tflow %&gt;%
  plug_resample(vfold_cv, v = 5) %&gt;%
  plug_grid(expand.grid, tree_depth = c(1, 3, 9), min_n = c(50, 100)) %&gt;%
  replace_model(update(dectree, min_n = tune(), tree_depth = tune()))

fit_tuned &lt;- fit(tflow)
fit_tuned %&gt;% pull_tflow_fit_tuning() %&gt;% show_best(metric = "rmse")
```

```
# A tibble: 5 x 7
  tree_depth min_n .metric .estimator  mean     n std_err
       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;
